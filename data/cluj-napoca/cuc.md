Probably the only good coworking cafe in Cluj-Napoca, it has an amazing common table for setting up your laptop, but no back support on the stools.

Still, great vibes, great music, great coffee. They sometimes host artist galleries during the day and events in the evening.

Good selection of coffee beans, kombucha, local wines and beers. No food but good snacks and desserts.
