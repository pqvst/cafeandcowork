To get here, get into the Asti Hotel building and find an elavator that isn't guestrooms only, then take to the 24th floor. Incredible views, there's a patio if you need some fresh air. The space itself is free but your must register before coming or at the counter when you arrive. After that every time you use this space you also need to book it on their website, the counter staff can guide you, they speak fluent English. It doesn't sell any drink or food but there are Ten-percent, Compose, and Starbucks nearby.
