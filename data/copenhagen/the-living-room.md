The Living Room is a cozy cafe with a great atmosphere. It's very quiet in the morning when I was there, however it got more crowded during lunch time. Prices are a little high, but the quality or both food and drinks is good and the selection of both is great. The only place that had power outlets was on the upper floor and with the sun shining through the windows the laptop gets very warm, so beware. The downstairs floor with the sofas was definitely more comfortable.
