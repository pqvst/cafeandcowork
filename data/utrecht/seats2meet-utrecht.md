A free coworking space near Utrecht central station. You can use the space for free in exchange for knowledge sharing and networking. It even comes with free tea/coffee!

To use the space, simply create a profile on their website, make a reservation online, and then check-in at the counter when you arrive. There's wifi (although a little slow), power outlets, plenty of seating in different areas.

The entrance is a little tricky to find. Find the "Hoog Overborch" door next to the Albert Heijn supermarket inside the Hoog Catharijne mall. Press the buzzer for "Seats2meet" and then go up one floor (elevator or stairs).
