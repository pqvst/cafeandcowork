A fantastic cafe to work from. I ended up coming here several days while visiting Buenos Aires. There's a large outdoor seating area, the main indoor area, and even a small second floor area overlooking the cafe. Serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and has a large selection of beverages and an extensive offering of teas. Fast WiFi and some power outlets available.
