The hotel has a small café in the lobby with a few tables. It's usually not very busy and there's plenty of space to work, both bigger tables as well as a few smaller ones. All of them have power. There is no wifi for external guests. The coffee is decent and quite cheap compared to most places around. They seemed strangely reluctant of letting me use the restrooms when I said I wasn't staying at the hotel even after I had purchased coffee.
