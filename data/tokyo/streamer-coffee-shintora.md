Another branch of Streamer Coffee in a quiet neighborhood. The seats were fairly empty on a weekday, probably because the area is basically lots of small offices and not too crowded with people like Shibuya. Also the fact it is bit of a walk from any nearby stations might also make it less crowded than other places. WiFi is very fast and reliable. There's only one seat with plugs which is the couch seat at the back.
