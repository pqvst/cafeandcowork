The cafe gives off a modern, clean, and possibly upscale vibe. The design is sleek with wood elements and exposed ceiling infrastructure, suggesting an industrial-chic aesthetic. The lighting is warm and inviting.

A great work spot not too far from Tokyo Station. There are two areas, a large room by the entrance, and another smaller room in the back. In the afternoon/evening the cafe was super quiet and great for working.

My only complaint would be that the chairs in the back room are not particularly comfortable for back support. I ended up using my backpack as an extra back support. Other than that, it's a great spot, and drink prices were surprisingly good as well.
