Very close to Shinjuku Station. Reception is friendly and speaks good English. When you enter tell the receptionist you'd like to use the open coworking space (or just say "drop in"). You'll receive a little folder with all wifi details, and a receipt that has a barcode. When you leave, hand this folder back to reception and they'll scan the barcode. This will determine the amount you'll pay for the time spent at the coworking space. Price is a bit high (¥165/15minutes), however gets capped at ¥3300 for 6 or more hours.

**Space**: The space is modern and well designed. There are plenty of power outlets and a coat rack to hang your jackets in the winter

**Seating**: There are several areas of tables and chairs. The tables against the windows have nice office chairs with high backs and headrests. Tables that are not against the windows still have comfortable chairs with cushioning. The tables not against the windows also have privacy screening so you cannot see the next person.

**Wifi**: Excellent

**Food/drinks**: There is a drinks machine that serves free tea/coffee/soda. There is also a 7-11 just around the corner so you can purchase any food or other drinks you want from there.

**Meeting rooms**: If you want to use the meeting rooms, you will have to book in advance. Please talk to reception for this.

**Overall**: A really cool space, comfortable work area, good location right by Shinjuku station.
