I'm not quite sure if this is a permanent location or just a popup shop. Order on the ground floor, and then there are two floors of seating. It wasn't very busy when I visited on a weekday morning, however, the interior is very echoey, so if anyone is talking inside it feels noisy. There is a tiny restroom on the first floor.
