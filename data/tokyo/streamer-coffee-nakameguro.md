A great workable cafe near Nakameguro. You'll find very fast wifi, power outlets, a large worktable, and nice window-facing counter seats. There's a nice selection of drinks and cakes/snacks as well. There is a 2 hour time-limit though, and the seats aren't the most comfortable - but it's definitely a nice spot to hang out at for a while if you're in the area.
