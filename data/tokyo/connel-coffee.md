An interesting cafe located on the second floor of an office building. Once you enter the building take a right and you'll see a sign leading you up the stairs. The cafe space is split into two parts. A smaller space by counter, and a larger space half a floor up. It was surprisingly busy during the morning on a weekday.

There is WiFi, but I didn't see any power outlets. I didn't see any restrooms (but I'm sure there must be some restrooms in the building). Drink felt a little non-premium since it was served in a plastic cup.
