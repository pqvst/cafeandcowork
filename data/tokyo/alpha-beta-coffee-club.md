A small but cozy spot near Jiyugaoka station. It's located on the 3rd floor of the building with the 7-11. Take the elevator up. The space has a large work table, some small tables, and outdoor seating. Lots of natural light. There's a 2 hour time limit. I don't think there are any power outlets (at least I didn't see any).
