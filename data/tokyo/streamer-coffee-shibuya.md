Another great cafe between Shibuya and Harajuku. Plenty of seating (including counter seats and a large worktable), power outlets, and ok WiFi. Seats aren't the most comfortable, so I wouldn't plan to stay too long. Also the music volume was very loud so noise cancelling headphones was a must for me. Not ideal for working, but still a nice place to have a beverage, with good vibes.
