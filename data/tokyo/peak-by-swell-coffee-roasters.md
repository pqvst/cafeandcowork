Large space, plenty of seating, and definitely suitable/comfortable for working, with fast WiFi and power outlets. It was pretty empty on a weekday. I tried their yakisoba-sandwich, which was pretty good. Drink options are a bit limited, especially for non-coffee alternatives. We did spot a huge cockroach while we were there (the staff took care of it though).
