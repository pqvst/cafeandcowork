A nice, large Verve not too far from Roppongi station. Large outdoor seating area, some seating on the 1st floor, and even more seating on the 2nd floor. I saw some power outlets on the 1st floor (not sure about the 2nd floor).

The "vervecoffee" WiFi is usually pretty bad. The "TOKYO FREE Wi-Fi" is best (faster and more stable), but it requires registration. Instructions are available here: https://wi-fi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/en/
