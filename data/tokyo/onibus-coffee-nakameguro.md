There's a small second floor seating area, with nice windows overlooking the train tracks. It seems to be a very popular tourist destination though, with a lot of people constantly taking photos and selfies. It can be a bit distracting. Mornings are probably best if you want a relaxing environment. Contrary to what some reviews say, there is WiFi that works well. There is a power outlet as well.
