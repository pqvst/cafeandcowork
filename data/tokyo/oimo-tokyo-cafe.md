A nice cafe specializing in gluten free cakes. It feels like the type of place that gets very busy on weekends, but on a weekday it was pretty empty. It filled up a bit in the later afternoon though. Its definitely on the pricey side, but the weekday cake set was a good option, the cheesecake was really delicious!
