A very small coffee shop not too far from Kichijoji station. I was there on a weekday after lunch and it was empty (I was the only one there), which felt a bit awkward for being such a small space. Also, it doesn't seem like they have any real AC (just a small portable AC unit), so it was really hot and uncomfortable inside during the summer. There's no WiFi either, but I was able to pick up the LACOSTE-GUEST WiFi, which worked pretty well. Menu was fairly limited in terms of coffee alternatives.
