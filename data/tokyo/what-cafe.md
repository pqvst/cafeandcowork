Cafe and art exhibition. The space is really big and not especially busy on a weekday. There's decent WiFi and a small menu with drinks and lunch options as well. Tables and chairs aren't the most ergonomic, but it works for a little while at least. There is public outdoor seating by the river as well, which would be a nice option when the weather is good.

Note: Be sure to check their calendar to confirm opening days, since they may close for holidays, private events, and during exhibition replacement period: https://cafe.warehouseofart.org/calendar/
