A small local café in central Malmö. They have a very small downstairs area (Just 1 or 2 seats) and a slightly larger upstairs area that fits about 10 people. There is no Wi-Fi but quite a few power outlets, so bring your own personal hotspot. There's no food to speak of, just some sandwiches but a lot of cakes. The drink selection covers the basics, coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and some other hot drinks.
