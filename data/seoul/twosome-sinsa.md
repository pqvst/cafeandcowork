There are two floors, almost every tables along the wall has sockets, a pretty good amount of unoccupied seats even in a Friday afternoon. Toilet smelled terrible the day I went, the lid hinge seems to be broken. After around 5 P.M. the streets starts to get more vibrant and unfortunately also more noisy.
