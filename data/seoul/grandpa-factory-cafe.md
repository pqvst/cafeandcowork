A massive cafe in Seongsu featuring two floors of indoor seating, a courtyard, a rooftop, and a treehouse! There are many large worktables, suitable for groups. The WiFi is good, and there are power outlets along the walls (although some of the sockets weren't working). There's a large many with food and drink. I tried the pasta which was absolutely fantastic. It looks like they serve wood fired pizza as well. Overall, a fantastic place to spend the day working.
