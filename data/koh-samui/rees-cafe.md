A relatively large café by Koh Samui standards with a total of 4 tables each seating 4 people. The café is located next to a large square making it slightly more quiet than most other cafés in the area which usually face busy roads. The Wifi is blazingly fast and the drinks are great with a huge selection of both hot and cold drinks as well as some cocktails and beers. They offer happy hour prices on alcohol from 3pm to 5pm. There's no power outlets so keep that in mind if you plan to stay longer, but you could probably ask the very nice owners to charge a device for a few minutes in a pinch. There's not much in the way of food other than a few cakes which all looked delicious.
