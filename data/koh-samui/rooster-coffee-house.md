A very small café with great Wifi. There's only 2 real tables, each fitting 4 people, as well as a couch but no power outlets. The owners were very friendly though so you could probably ask to charge your devices in a pinch. The coffee is really good and there's a cute cat roaming the café which you may find distracting or fun depending on your perspective (The owner was very quick to try and remove it when it jumped up on the table before we said it was OK). The place is pretty quiet indoors but the road outside is quite busy so there's some noise. They play some chill music which adds to the atmosphere. Prices are reasonable, about 70 THB for an Americano and 80 THB for a cappuccino. They don't have any food, only drinks, and no toilet.
