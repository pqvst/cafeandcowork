A cozy café located next to the SALA resort. They have a great selection of coffee drinks and delicious ice creams. The place was completely empty at 10 AM on a Monday so finding a seat is not a problem. There's wifi that's plenty fast but unfortunately only two power outlets by the wall so most seats don't have power. They're playing some very chill lounge music and since the café is almost empty it's very quiet. If you want to sit outside there's a few seats in front of the building, however they face a busy road and the sun is quite strong in the morning so staying indoors is probably better. Overall a nice place to relax and get some work done while enjoying good coffee and ice cream. Prices are reasonable, about 130 THB for a very large V60 pour over and 155 THB for a matcha lemonade.
