    Another review from my recent trip to Toucheng. This time a castle on top of the mountain! Getting there is a little tricky since there is no public transportation and it's quite far up the mountain. Taxi is probably your best option in that case. Once you get up the mountain there are two cafes, Castle I and Castle II. We decided to start with Castle II since the reviews said it was less busy (and that was definitely true). The interior is very large, lots of seating areas and large windows. It did get a little noisy though, even on a weekday afternoon. Unfortunately the upper floor was closed at this location. Decent WiFi and plugs available near the walls.

    Before heading down we visited Castle I as well. This location looks nicer, and the upper floors (as well as the rooftop) were all open. There is also a very nice outdoor seating area. But, as the reviews I read said, this location was very busy. Finally after finishing up some work we walked down the mountain to Wai'ao beach, which took about 30 minutes.

    A cool place to visit, it's definitely workable and fun to see, but I'm not sure I could spend the whole day there working.

    這是另外一則在頭城之旅寫下的評論，關於在山上的城堡！這地方其實有點不好去，因為沒有大眾運輸工具，且沿路是滿長的山坡路，我想計程車是比較好的選擇(除非你也想運動一下)。上了山以後會看到兩間Cafe，Castle一號和二號，我們決定先前往二號城堡，因為google評論說二號比較不熱鬧(確實是如此)。

    二號城堡的內部有非常大的空間，很多座位區以及開闊的窗戶，平日下午也稍嫌吵雜，二樓區域沒開放也有點可惜，不過這裡有不錯的WiFi和許多牆邊的插座。

    我們在下山之前還拜訪了一號城堡，地點看起來更加方便，也有二樓區域(和屋頂天台)，戶外區域看起來特別開闊，但就和我在評論上看到的一樣，這裡顯然非常忙碌。結束工作後我們選擇一路走下山，來到知名的外澳沙灘，路程大約要走上三十分鐘。 

    整體來說這裡是個很有趣的地方，絕對適合游牧工作也很適合遊覽，不過我想我可能沒辦法在這裡待上一整天好好專注在工作上面，這裡太多令人分心的事物了。
