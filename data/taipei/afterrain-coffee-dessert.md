Really cozy cafe for when the weather is cold and rainy. Their specialty is matcha cakes. Minimum order is one drink or dessert.

Good selection of drinks. They have both comfortable couch-style seating with power outlets, as well as a large communal table with _many_ power outlets.

It gets quite busy in the weekends with people coming to enjoy their cakes and desserts, so I suggest coming early.
