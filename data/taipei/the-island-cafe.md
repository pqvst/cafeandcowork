A very nice looking cafe located in an old traditional building which looks really nice from the outside. The interior feels quite cozy, with both counter seats and tables. It was very quiet in the morning but got quite busy around lunch. Most seats seem to have access to power and the WiFi was quite fast. They have an extensive drinks and food menu.
