A short walk from the Grand Front area. It was very quiet on a weekday (just one other customer while I was there). The staff was very friendly. There are some power outlets if you need, and the "USEN Free WiFi" was very fast. Be careful with the low door frame in the restroom as I managed to bang my head on it!
